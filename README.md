Welcome to my 15-112 S22 Term Project: Marching Cubes 112!

Marching Cubes 112 is a terrain visualizer that uses the Marching Cubes Algorithm to visualize a mesh of different terrains in pseudo 3d (through linear algebra projection matrices). Users can either create and edit a 2d height map, which they can then visualize a mesh of in 3d, or they can input and visualize a mesh of a f(x,y,z) terrain function which they can edit by changing surface levels and (x,y,z) point values.

To run this program, first install numpy and opensimplex libraries. Then, access 'main.py' in your editor to start the program. Note: all python files and images included are necessary for this program to run properly.
